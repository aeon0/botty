## Getting started
### 1) Graphics and Gameplay Settings
All settings will automatically be set when you execute `run.exe` and press the hotkey for "Adjust D2R settings" (default f9). Note that D2R should not run during this process, or if it does you will have to restart afterwards. The important ones are listed here:

- Resolution: 1920x1080 (Fullscreen)
- Gamma: 155
- Item Label Display: Hold
- Large Font Mode: on

**Note**: There have been issues reported with image sharpening being truned on via the graphic card settings itself outside of D2R. Try turning it off when running the bot.

### 2) Supported builds
#### Soceress
You can put any skills on left and right attack and see if it works out. E.g. Glacial Spike on left attack and Blizzard or right attack.
Adjust the hotkeys in the __param.ini__ for the `[char]` and `[sorceress]` section accordingly. Check out the param.ini section in the Readme for more details on each param.
#### Hammerdin
Your standard Hammerdin with Enigma. Dont think I have to explain much here.

### 3) Start Location
Open up D2R and wait till you are at the hero selection screen. Make sure the char you running with is selected and will be in A5 hell when starting a hell game.

### 5) Start Botty
Download the a prebuilt release [here](https://github.com/aeon0/botty/releases). Start `run.exe` in the botty folder, go to D2R window and press the "resume" key. Move to your D2R window and press "f11". You can always force stop botty with f12.

## Color Test Mode
To check if you graphic settings are good and if the bot would pick up items there is a **Color Test Mode** built in. Start botty and press F10 (Default key). This will open up a (mostly black) window. Start a game in D2R and throw some items of different type on the ground. If you now bring forward the debug window all items should show up with their names while the background is black. If you throw an item on the ground that should be picked up, it will have a red circle.</br>

## Development
Check out the [development.md](development.md) docu for infos on how to build from source and details of the project structure and code.

## param.ini
To ease the switch to new botty versions, you can also overwrite any of the param.ini fields in a __custom.ini__ file. When a new version of botty is released you just copy the file to the new version without having to port all your __param.ini__ changes to the new version. Example:
```ini
; custom.ini - overwrites 3 params in the param.ini
[general]
monitor=1

[routes]
run_pindle=1
run_shenk=0
```

resume_key | After starting the exe botty will wait for this keypress to atually start botting away
color_checker_key | Pressing this key will start a debug mode to check if the color filtering works with your settings. It also includes the item search and marks items it would pick up with red circles

 [routes]                       | Descriptions
