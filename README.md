Pixelbot for Diablo 2 Resurrected. This project is for informational and educational purposes only.

## Getting started & Prerequisites
- D2R needs to be in English Language,
- Botty currently works with 720p D2R window (will be adjusted automatically on auto settings)

### 1) Graphics and Gameplay Settings

All settings will automatically be set when you execute `main.exe` and press the hotkey for "Adjust D2R settings" (default f9). It is not a 100% thing, in rare cases you might still have to fiddle around with your brightness. I suggest using the "Graphic Debugger" to verify your settings.
**Note**: Make sure that no other external programs adapt your graphics settings (HDR, Geforce Experience, etc.)

### 2) Supported builds

Botty will auto-detect hotkeys for the character using **params.ini** saved_games_folder and key_file and use the **params.ini** type to "pilot" the character.

The logic for "piloting", as well as supported **params.ini** types can be found in the [char folder](https://github.com/bottytools/botty/tree/master/src/char).

### 3) Start Location

Open up D2R and wait till you are at the hero selection screen. Make sure the char you running with is selected and will be in any of Act 3, 4 or 5 in the respective difficulty you set in the **params.ini** once the bot starts the game.

### 4) Start Botty

You can either run from python. Follow [development.md](development.md) for that. Or you download the a prebuilt release [here](https://github.com/aeon0/botty/releases) (the .rar file!). Start `main.exe` in the botty folder. Focus your D2R window and press the start key (default f11). You can always force stop botty with f12. Note: Botty will use the /nopickup command in the first game to avoid pickup up trash while traversing. This command will only allow item pickup when "show items" is active.

## Development

Check out the [development.md](development.md) docu for infos on how to build from source and details of the project structure and code.

## BNIP Pickit

Botty NIP (BNIP) is an extended version of Njaguar's Item Parser (NIP).
BNIP is compatible with NIP (with some minor exceptions as discussed below).

There is a default nip file that comes with botty called "default.nip" inside config folder, you can add your own nip files by putting them inside config/nip with a file extension of .nip. Creating your own nip file also turns off the default.nip.

We suggest you read the NIP guide if you are unfamiliar with NIP https://github.com/blizzhackers/pickits/blob/master/NipGuide.md

### New features in BNIP

Poison damage is no longer calculated, but is now read as it's raw value. Example: Adds 5-10 poison damage over 1 seconds can be picked with `[poisonmindam] == 5 && [poisonmaxdam] == 10`. "313 Poison Damage over 5 seconds" can be picked with `[poisonmindam] == 313` or  `[poisonmaxdam] == 313`.

`[allres]` is a thing now. example: `[type] == amulet && [quality] == unique # [allres] == 30` will pick up Mara's

`[idname]` can now be used for unique / set items. For example, `[idname] == thestoneofjordan` will pick up SoJ. Keep in mind, however, this forces the item to be ID'd so be careful if you want to keep unid items.

`[maxquantity]` is not supported (yet). You can leave those tags in but they'll do nothing.

If you have the discord webhook hooked up to alert you when the bot keeps items, you can suppress these alerts by adding a "@" in front of your expression.

@[type] == ring = no notification
[type] == ring = notification

## Graphic Debugger

To check if you graphic settings are good and if the bot would pick up items there is a **Graphic Debugger Mode**. Start botty and press F10 (Default key). This will open up a (mostly black) window. Start a game in D2R and go to A5. You should see some templates with blue circles detected and scores printed out to the console. To check item finding, throw some items of different types on the ground. The debug window should show the item names with black background. If you throw an item on the ground that should be picked up, it will have a red circle. The console will print out the scores for each item that would be picked up. Scores should be well above 0.9 for these items.</br>

## params.ini

All botty configuration files are located in the __config__ folder. To ease the switch to new botty versions, you can also overwrite any of the .ini fields in a **custom.ini** file. When a new version of botty is released you just copy the file to the new version without having to port all your **params.ini** changes to the new version. Example:

```ini
; custom.ini - overwrites 2 params in the params.ini
[general]
name=MyCustomName

[routes]
order=run_pindle, run_eldritch
```
