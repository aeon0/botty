Simple Pixelbot for Diablo 2 Resurrected single player written in python and opencv. Botty does not work for online games and is not intended for this usage!
[**Download here**](https://github.com/aeon0/botty/releases). Got to have a [**Discord**](https://discord.gg/Jf3J8cuXWg) nowadays I guess :man_shrugging:

And please. I urge you to actually read that README! It will make your life a lot easier.

## Getting started

Botty only supports English language! Botty is currently working in 720p and will either switch to windowed mode or to fullscreen depending on your current monitor res when you run the "Auto Settings".</br>
It is highly recommended to let botty run with /nopickup active. This will reduce the amount of accidently picked up trash by a lot. Espacially when playing builds without teleport.

### 1) Graphics and Gameplay Settings

All settings will automatically be set when you execute `run.exe` and press the hotkey for "Adjust D2R settings" (default f9). Note that D2R should not run during this process, or if it does you will have to restart afterwards. It is not a 100% thing, in rare cases you might still have to fiddle around with your brightness. I suggest using the "Graphic Debugger" to verify your settings.
**Note**: There have been issues reported with image sharpening being truned on via the graphic card settings itself outside of D2R. Try turning it off when running botty. Also HDR should be truned off.

### 2) Supported builds

#### Sorceress

You can put any skills on left and right attack and see if it works out. E.g. Glacial Spike on left attack and Blizzard or right attack.
Adjust the hotkeys in the **custom.ini** or **param.ini** for the `[char]` and `[sorceress]` section accordingly. Check out the param.ini section in the Readme for more details on each param.

#### Hammerdin

Your standard Hammerdin. Same story as with sorc, set up your skills in the .ini file to what you have in D2R or the other way around. When running more than just pindle or shenk you need to start with a full tome of tps in your inventory. If you do not have an engima, leave the teleport hotkey empty in the .ini file and the hammerdin will run with vigor instead.

#### Other builds

You can "highjack" the sorc or hdin config to also run other builds. There will be a more flexibel char system comming up in the upcoming releases.

### 3) Start Location

Open up D2R and wait till you are at the hero selection screen. Make sure the char you running with is selected and will be in A5 in the respective difficulty you set in the **param.ini** once the bot starts the game.

### 4) Start Botty

You can either run from python. Follow [development.md](development.md) for that. Or you download the a prebuilt release [here](https://github.com/aeon0/botty/releases). Start `run.exe` in the botty folder. Focus your D2R window window and press the start key (default f11). You can always force stop botty with f12.

## Graphic Debugger

To check if you graphic settings are good and if the bot would pick up items there is a **Graphic Debugger Mode** built in. Start botty and press F10 (Default key). This will open up a (mostly black) window. Start a game in D2R and go to A5. You should see some templates with blue circles detected and scores printed out to the console. E.g. for 720p you should see scores higher 0.8 for the templates. To check item finding, throw some items of different types on the ground. The debug window should show the item names with black background. If you throw an item on the ground that should be picked up, it will have a red circle. The console will print out the scores for each item that would be picked up. Scores should be well above 0.9 for these items.</br>

## Development

Check out the [development.md](development.md) docu for infos on how to build from source and details of the project structure and code.

## param.ini

To ease the switch to new botty versions, you can also overwrite any of the param.ini fields in a **custom.ini** file. When a new version of botty is released you just copy the file to the new version without having to port all your **param.ini** changes to the new version. Example:

```ini
; custom.ini - overwrites 3 params in the param.ini
[general]
monitor=1

[routes]
run_pindle=1
run_shenk=0
```
